# qc_code_examples
This repository is intended to store my coding excercises from my Quantum Computing learnings.

# Description
I always wanted to learn how to program quantum computer. And here it is! The battlefield/sandbox (call it as you prefer) of my learnings. The plan is to learn few different frameworks, like IBM Qiskit or PennyLane, etc. Usualy the code will be raw, naming conventions won't be consistent and generally speaking it will have low quality. But it is not a problem, since this code is not intended to become a product or be a part of my portfolio. It is intented to train how to use some frameworks to implement theoretical ideas from the fastly developing field of quantum computing.
